This project is about navigation system that will tell the path from 
landmark to another landmark. Our program contain 2 option
1. Search for location
2. Navigation direction

Completed:
Search for location - This function will let the user
type in the lanmark name inorder to check is the lanmark exist or not. The users can
type both alias and normal name of the landamrk, after that the system will display
all of the name from partial search and let the user choose decide which one is correct.

Completed:
Navigation direction - is that we will let user type in a current landmark name
and a designated landmark name, the system will find the shortest path
and minimum distance by using Dijkstra algorithm. It will also tell the road name,
compass direction, and the distance of each location that pass.


listed of file and fucntion that we borrow from Dr. Sally:
- minPriorityQueue.c  (used it without modification)
- minPriorityQueue.h  (used it without modification)
- Function: vertexCompare from lab 10 (used it without modification)
